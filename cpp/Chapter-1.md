## Compiler
C++ is a compiled programming language, which means that programmers use a program to compile their human-readable source code into machine-readable object and executable files. The program that performs this task is called a compiler .

C++ does not have an "official" compiler. Instead, there are many different compilers that a programmer can use. 

## Build Tools
Make and CMake are two separate and similar build tools that both serve to help simplify the process of building software.

In particular, build tools automate the process of compiling multiple source code files into object files, linking those object files together, and generating an executable. Build tools also often automate the process of determining which files have changed since the last build and thus need to be recompiled.
