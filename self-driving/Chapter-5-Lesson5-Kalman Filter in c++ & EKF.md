## Lesson 5 Kalman Filter in c++ & EKF
- You have already known how apply Kalman filter to estimation problems. But only use it to combine sequential measurements from **one sensor**.

- Actually, it's also possible to use Kalman filters to combine measurements from different sensors, and that's why we use it in sensor fusion

- **EKF** is able to handling more complex motion models and measurement models.
