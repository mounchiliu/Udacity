## Lesson 5 Kalman Filter in c++ & EKF
- You have already known how apply Kalman filter to estimation problems. But only use it to combine sequential measurements from **one sensor**.

- Actually, it's also possible to use Kalman filters to combine measurements from different sensors, and that's why we use it in sensor fusion

- **EKF** is able to handling more complex **motion models and measurement models**.

- you have two sensors, a lidar and a radar
- the information provided by these sensors is used to estimate the state of a moving pedestrian
  - this state is represented by a 2D position and a 2D velocity
- each time we receive new measurements from a given sensor, the estimation function is triggered
  - at this point we perform two steps, State Prediction and Measurement Update
  - in the prediction step, we predict the pedestrian state and its covariance
    - we do so by taking into account the elapsed time between the current and the previous observations
- the measurement update step depends on sensor type (**use the new observations to correct our belief about the state of the pedestrian**)
  - there are two cases that we'll see, Laser and Radar
  - if the current measurements are generated by a laser sensor, then we just apply a standard Kalman filter to update the pedestrian's state
  - however, radar measurements involve a nonlinear measurement function
    - so when we receive radar measurements, we use different tweaks to handle the measurement update
    - for instance, we may use Extended Kalman filter equations, which you'll see later
