    "- Initializing the State Vector\n",
    "  - you'll need to initialize the state vector with the first sensor measurement\n",
    "  - although radar gives velocity data in the form of the range rate $\\dot{\\rho}$, a radar measurement does not contain enough information to determine the state variable velocities $v_x$ and $v_y$\n",
    "    - you can, however, use the radar measurements $\\rho$ and $\\phi$ to initialize the state variable locations $p_x$ and $p_y$\n",

    "- Calculating $y = z - H * x'$\n",

    "  - for radar measurements, the functions that map the $x$ vector $[p_x, p_y, v_x, v_y]$ to polar coordinates are non-linear\n",
    "    - instead of using $H$ to calculate $y = z - H * x'$, for radar measurements you'll have to use the equations that map from cartesian to polar coordinates: $y = z - h(x')$\n",

    "  - the Kalman filter is expecting small angle values between the range $-\\pi$ and $\\pi$\n",

    "  - before and while calculating the Jacobian matrix Hj, make sure your code avoids dividing by zero\n",
