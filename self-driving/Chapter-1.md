- **Two distinct ways to autonomous developme**

1. Robotics approach

Fuses output from difference sensors to directly measure the vehicle surroundings and then navigate.

3. Deep learning approach

Deep neural networks allow self-driving cars to learn how to drive by mimicking human driving behavior.
