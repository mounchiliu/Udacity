1. **Two distinct ways to autonomous developme**

-  Robotics approach

Fuses output from difference sensors to directly measure the vehicle surroundings and then navigate.

- Deep learning approach

Deep neural networks allow self-driving cars to learn how to drive by mimicking human driving behavior.
